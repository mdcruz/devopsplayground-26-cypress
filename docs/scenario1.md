# Scenario 1

For our first test scenario, let's validate that the header is displaying correctly. Going back to Visual Studio code, click on `cypress/integration/image.gallery.spec.js`

Let's switch back to the Cypress test runner. By using the [selector playground](cypress-test-runner.md#selector-playground) feature, hover on the title and it should give you `#title` as its selector.

For the icons list selector, let's use `.icons ul li`.

Using some of the commands on [Cheat sheet](cheat-sheet.md), our sample code should look like:

```
it('should display the title correctly', () => {
  cy.get('#title').should('have.text', ' Marie Cruz ');
  cy.get('.icons ul li').should('have.length', 3);
});
```
